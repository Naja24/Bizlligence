# Bizlligence AutoML Platform

## Overview
Bizlligence AutoML Platform is a modular, production-level automated machine learning system built from scratch using Python. The project provides a comprehensive pipeline for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training/evaluation for supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised tasks. This system is designed with scalability and future integration in mind (e.g., UI integration and advanced time series analysis).

## Features
- **Automated Data Cleaning:** Removes duplicates, handles missing values (using SimpleImputer/KNNImputer), and detects/removes outliers.
- **Robust Feature Engineering:** Automatically detects numeric and categorical columns, applies scaling (StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler), optional normalization, one-hot encoding, and polynomial expansion.
- **Modular Preprocessing Pipeline:** Combines cleaning and feature transformation into a single, easy-to-use pipeline.
- **Flexible Model Training:** Supports various models for classification, regression, and more (grid search and evaluation).
- **Future Enhancements:** Planned integration of a user-friendly UI and support for advanced time series analysis tasks.
